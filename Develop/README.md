# NewCM-Radix - Develop folder

This folder contains the development files for NewCM-Radix. Brief notes follow:

When a new version of the New Computer Modern font is made available on CTAN, the script "Update.bat" can be executed to generate the updated ttf fonts.

The file FontSpecification.xlsx can be used to control the behavior of the updater, and subsequently the installer. For the new specification to take effect, the last column of the FontSpecification.xlsx file needs to be pasted in FontSpecification.py
